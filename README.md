# De-novo-metatranscriptomic-analysis-workflow
RNA-sequencing is an important tool to reveal the identity and metabolic capability of the active members. Total RNA (i.e. ribosomal and messenger RNAs) can be used to profile the taxonomic and functional diversity in an environmental sample. This workflow first separates rRNA from mRNA and assembles them independently. Each assembly is followed by annotation and statistics calculation.
